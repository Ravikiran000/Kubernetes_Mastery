#### Pod
Pods are the smallest and simplest unit of deployment. A pod represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster and can contain one or more containers, usually Docker containers. 
In summary, a pod represents one instance of an application running in the cluster, and it can be scaled up or down as needed to meet the application's requirements.
