## Kubernetes Services
A Kubernetes Service is a way to expose an application running on a set of Pods. Since Pods are ephemeral and their IP addresses change, Services provide a stable endpoint for communication.
### Key Features of Kubernetes Services
1. **Discovery and Load Balancing** : Services enable automatic discovery of Pods and distribute traffic across them.
2. **Stable Networking**: Services maintain a stable IP address and DNS name, even if the underlying Pods are replaced.
3. **Flexible Exposures**: Services allow exposing applications internally within the cluster or externally to the internet.

### Types of Kubernetes Services
#### 1. ClusterIP (Default):
- Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster.
- Accessible only within the cluster.
- **Use Case**: Internal communication between microservices.

### ClusterIP Implementation:
1. Deploy an application and expose it using ClusterIP
```
kubectl create deployment app1 --image kiran2391993/kubegame:v1 --replicas 2
kubectl expose deployment app1 --port 80 --target-port 80 --type ClusterIP  
```
2. Try to access the application
```
nslookup app1
curl http://app1
```
You can't access the application,since you are not inside the cluster and using ClusterIP service type.

3. Create a pod which has troubleshooting tools like nslookup, curl, etc and login to the pod and try to access the deployment.
```
kubectl run troubleshootpod --image kiran2361993/troubleshootingtools:v1
kubectl exec -it troubleshootpod -- bash
nslookup app1
curl http://app1
```
You can access the application. Logout of the pod and try to access the deployment application, you can't access it since you are  outside of the cluster.
**NOTE:** Delete the service & Deployemnt after the work is done
#### 2. NodePort
- Exposes the Service on a static port on each Nodeâ€™s IP.
- Accessible from outside the cluster via <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.
- **Use Case**: Simple external access for debugging or testing.

### NodePort Implementation:
